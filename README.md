# Python Scientific Examples

This repository contains a collection of simple, self‑contained Python scripts demonstrating scientific computing and plotting concepts. Each file focuses on one example, typically involving mathematical functions or basic visualization.

## 📁 Repository Contents

Below are the included example scripts (based on your repository screenshot):

* **eg3‑sin2x.py** — plots the function *sin(2x)*.
* **ex‑p3.1.1.py** — scientific example #3.1.1 (content depends on the script).
* **ex‑p3.1.3.py** — scientific example #3.1.3.
* **ex‑p3.2.1.py** — scientific example #3.2.1.

Each script can be run independently and typically generates a plot using libraries such as `matplotlib`.

   * `matplotlib`
   * `numpy`

   Install them with:

   ```bash
   pip3 install matplotlib numpy
   ```

3. **Run any script:**

   ```bash
   python3 eg3-sin2x.py
   ```

Each script will display a plot window or save an output figure depending on how it is written.
